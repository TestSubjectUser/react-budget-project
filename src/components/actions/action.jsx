// Purpose: Actions are used to handle data mutations, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources. They are executed in response to user interactions, typically through forms.

// Usage:
// Actions can be defined in the route configuration and are called when a form is submitted.
// They can be either server actions (executed on the server) or client actions (executed in the browser).

export const action = async ({ request }) => {
  console.log("performing action from PrevEntries component action");
  //   const formData = await request.formData();
  //   const title = formData.get("title");
  const title = "--Title--";
  // Perform mutation, e.g., create or update a resource
  return { success: true, title };
};

// Actions in React Router are executed whenever the application sends a non-GET submission, such as POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE, to a route. This typically occurs in response to form submissions or other user interactions that trigger data mutations. ### When Actions Are Executed
// Form Submissions: Actions are primarily triggered when a form is submitted. This can be done using the <Form> component provided by React Router, which automatically sends the form data to the specified action.
// Imperative Submissions: Actions can also be executed imperatively using the useSubmit hook. This allows for programmatic control over when and how the action is called, such as in response to specific events or conditions.
// Fetchers: Using the useFetcher hook allows for submitting data to actions without causing a navigation. This is useful for background operations where you want to update data without changing the current view.

// // Example of a form that triggers an action on submission
// <Form method="post" action="/create-post">
//   <input type="text" name="title" required />
//   <textarea name="content" required></textarea>
//   <button type="submit">Create Post</button>
// </Form>

// Actions are executed on non-GET submissions, primarily through form submissions or programmatic calls using hooks.
// They allow for data mutations, ensuring that the application can handle user interactions effectively and maintain a responsive user interface.
